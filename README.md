# Interactive-Student-Database-Management-System-USing-C-
An interactive student database management system implemented using C++. Aimed at demonstrating object-oriented design and programming for solving real problems. The system maintains student information (student number, name, and subjects) in binary and text formats. It allows the user to perform operations as reading student information (from either of the binary or text sources), displaying a specific student record, updating an existing record, adding a new student record (provided the maximum capacity of the database has not yet been exceeded) and writing to the binary and text files. The system provides an interactive interface for accomplishing the aforementioned list of features.
